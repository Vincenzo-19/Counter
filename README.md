<p>This is my first project using JavaScript. I have created a counter where the value and buttons are built only with JS, and I used HTML & CSS only for styling the body, the card, and the h1 tag.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>The counter I have created is simple. There is a value that starts at 0, then the -/+ buttons which respectively decrement by 1 and increment by 1, and the reset button which sets the value back to 0.</p>
